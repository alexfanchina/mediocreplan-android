# Mediocre Plan

*Break Boredom and be COOL!*

Mediocre Plan is an app that allows you to discover cool tasks and be cool. This was an idea from my friend [Race](http://js.zjol.com.cn/ycxw_zxtf/201807/t20180716_7792033.shtml). In today's age, being cool is not so cool. We believe it the right way to break boredom to think about the future and start mediocre plans. 

Mediocre Plan (Android) is another showcase of Android development with [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) and MVVM architecture. It is a quite simple app, and hopefully the UI would let you feel tactile and understandable.
